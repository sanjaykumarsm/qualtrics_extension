-   If the anchor component for a `ColorPicker`, `Combobox`, `Dropdown`, `Menu`, `Popover`, `QuickSearch`, `SelectMenu`, `Slider`, or `Tooltip` is not visible in its scroll container, the tooltip/popover/flyout will become hidden.

### Added

-   Added `<FingerprintIcon>`

-   The following changes are for the `unstable_SearchInput`. The `className` prop and `style` prop will be provided to the containing `span` element instead of the `Input` component. The component will now only accept props explicitly listed in the SearchInput docs page, and the component no longer accepts a `ref`. The `onChange` prop now passes the input value instead of a DOM event.

### Fixed

-   Fixed issue where `setState` being called with an _unchanged_ value would trigger `onChange` handlers to be executed. This affected the following components: `<Combobox>`, `<Dropdown>`, `<FilePicker>`, `<Menu>`, `<SelectMenu>`, `<RangeSlider>`, `<Slider>`, `<Stepper>`, and `<Toolbar>`

---

---

## 1.15.0 - February 28, 2020

### Added

-   Add `<unstable_Dropdown>` component

---

## 1.14.0 - February 24, 2020

-   Fixed an issue where hovering over `<Input>`s inside of a `<SelectMenu>` would close the menu.

---

## 1.13.1 - February 19, 2020

### Fixed

-   Fixed an issue where modals would re-render every time a state change caused a parent component to re-render.

---

## 1.13.0 - February 18, 2020

### Added

-   Fix issue preventing `className` prop from being forwarded to the the `<FormField>` wrapper element
-   Fixed incorrect typings for the `<Combobox>` components.

---

## 1.12.1 - February 10, 2020

-   Updated `<LoadingSpinner>` to allow multiple children.

---

### Added

-   `<Pagination>` component.
-   Unstable translations (i18n), configurable via `<UIProvider>`.

### Changed

-   **Breaking:** The `<Input>` component used to override internally applied props with any additional props specified by the consumer. Additional props are still added to the `<Input>`, but are now overridden by internally applied props.
-   **Breaking:** The `<Input>` component `className` prop used to be applied to the internal container, but is now applied to the inner `input`/`textarea` element. This change was made to standardize on how additional props and top level `testId` and `className` will all be applied to the same underlying component/element.
